        <header><h1>The Death of Koschei the Immortal</h1></header>
        <p>Ivan Tsarevitch had three sisters, the first was Princess Maria, the second was Princess Olga, the third was Princess Anna. After his parents die and his sisters marry three wizards, he leaves his home in search of his sisters. He meets Marya Morevna, a beautiful warrior princess, and marries her. After a while she announces she is going to go to war and tells Ivan not to open the door of the dungeon in the castle they live in while she will be away. Overcome by the desire to know what the dungeon holds, he opens the door soon after her departure and finds Koschei, chained and emaciated. Koschei asks Ivan to bring him some water; Ivan does so. After Koschei drinks twelve buckets of water, his magic powers return to him, he breaks his chains and disappears. Soon after Ivan finds out that Koschei has captured Marya Morevna, and pursues him. When Ivan catches up with Koschei, Koschei tells Ivan to let him go, but Ivan does not give in, and Koschei kills him, puts his remains into a barrel and throws it into the sea. Ivan is revived by his sisters' husbands – powerful wizards who can transform into birds of prey. They tell him that Koschei has a magic horse and that Ivan should go to Baba Yaga to get one too, or else he will not be able to defeat Koschei. After Ivan survives Yaga's tests and gets the horse, he fights with Koschei, kills him and burns his body. Marya Morevna returns to Ivan, and they celebrate his victory with his sisters and their husbands.</p>
        <p><code>Koschei (Russian: Коще́й, tr. Koshchey)</code>, often given the epithet "the Immortal", or "the Deathless" (Russian: Коще́й Бессме́ртный), is an archetypal male antagonist in Russian folklore.</p>

        <header><h1>The Princess Who Never Smiled</h1></header>
        <p>There was once a princess who never smiled or laughed. Her father promised that whoever made her smile could marry her, and many tried, but none succeeded. </br>

Across the town, an honest worker worked hard for his master. At the end of the year, the master put a sack of money before him and told him to take as much as he wanted. To avoid sinning by taking too much, he took only one coin, and when he went to drink from a well, he dropped the coin and lost it. The next year, the same thing happened to him. The third year, the worker took the same amount of coin as before, but when he drank from the well, he did not lose his coin, and the other two coins floated up to him. He decided to see the world. A mouse asked him for alms; he gave him a coin. Then he did the same for a beetle and a catfish. </br>

He came to the castle and saw the princess looking at him. This astounded him, and he fell in the mud. The mouse, the beetle, and the catfish came to his aid, and at their antics, the princess laughed. She pointed him out as the man, and when he was brought into the castle, he had been turned into a handsome man. The honest worker, now a handsome man, married the princess.</p>
        <p><code>Making the princess laugh</code>, or smile, is a common fairy tale motif of various uses. The culmination of Golden Goose and The Magic Swan (both classified as ATU 571, "All Stick Together"), where the goose or swan causes other characters to stick to each other, is that the sight causes a princess to laugh for the first time. The result is ultimately the princess' marriage in each of these stories. Peruonto and the frame story of Giambattista Basile, however, depict stories where someone who has been laughed at casts a curse on the princess to force her to marry someone.</p>

        <header><h1>The Magic Swan Geese</h1></header>
        <p>Once there was a couple who had both a daughter and a son. They left their daughter in charge of her younger brother, but one day she lost track of him and the magic swan geese snatched him away. The daughter chased after him and came upon an oven that offered to tell her if she ate its rye buns; she scorned them, saying she didn't even eat wheat buns. She also scorned similar offers from an apple tree, and a river of milk. She came across a little hut built on a hen's foot, in which she found Baba Yaga with her brother; Baba Yaga sent her to spin flax and left. A mouse scurried out and said it would tell her what she needed to know if she gave it porridge; she did, and it told her that Baba Yaga was heating the bath house to steam her, then she would cook her. The mouse took over her spinning, and the girl took her brother and fled. </br>

Baba Yaga sent the swan geese after her. She begged the river for aid, and it insisted she drink some of it first; she did, and it sheltered her. When she ran on, the swan geese followed again, and the same happened with the apple tree and the oven. Then she reached home safely.</p>
        <p><code>Baba Yaga</code> is a supernatural being (or one of a trio of sisters of the same name) who appears as a deformed and/or ferocious-looking woman. In fairy tales Baba Yaga flies around in a mortar, wields a pestle, and dwells deep in the forest in a hut usually described as standing on chicken legs. Baba Yaga may help or hinder those who encounter or seek her out and may play a maternal role. She also has associations with forest wildlife. </p>

        <header><h1>The Language of the Birds</h1></header>
        <p>A merchant's son, Ivan, wanted to learn the language of the birds. One day while hunting, he saw four chicks about to be swamped by a storm, and sheltered them with his kaftan. When the mother bird returned, she, in gratitude, taught him the language of the birds.

He sat with his parents one night and was distressed by the nightingale's song. His father insisted on hearing what it said, and he told them that it had said he would be a king's son rather than a merchant's, and his own father would serve him as a servant. His parents, worried about what this meant, put him in a boat and shoved it off the shore. On the sea, a merchant found him. He warned the merchant that the birds spoke of a storm, and was ignored, but while they were repairing the storm damage, he warned them of pirates and they hid. Finally, they came to a city where a king was distressed by three crows that always perched by the king's window. He offered his youngest daughter's hand in marriage to anyone who would get rid of them.

Ivan went to listen to the birds and then asked for an audience. He told the king that the crows wanted a royal decision: should the young crow follow the father or the mother crow? The king said the father, and the mother crow went off alone, and the father with the young crow. The king married his youngest daughter to Ivan and gave him half his kingdom.

Meanwhile, his father had lost all his money and became a beggar. One day he begged outside Ivan's castle, and Ivan brought him in and gave him food and clothing and asked what he wanted. The father asked him to take him as a servant. Ivan told him that the song of the nightingale had come true, and provided for his parents.</p>
        <p>In Abrahamic and European mythology, medieval literature and occultism, <code>the language of the birds</code> is postulated as a mystical, perfect divine language, Adamic language, Enochian, angelic language or a mythical or magical language used by birds to communicate with the initiated.</p>

        <header><h1>The Firebird and Princess Vasilisa</h1></header>
        <p>A royal huntsman found a feather of the firebird and, though his horse warned him against it, picked it up. The king demanded that he bring him the bird. The huntsman went to his horse, who told him to demand that measures of corn be spread over the fields. He did, and the firebird came to eat and was caught.

He brought it to the king, who said that because he had done that, now he must bring him Princess Vasilisa to be his bride. The horse had him demand food and drink for the journey, and a tent with a golden top. With it, they set out to a lake where the princess was rowing with golden oars in a silver boat. He set up the tent and set out the food. The princess came and ate, and drinking foreign wine, she became drunk and slept. He carried her off.

Princess Vasilisa refused to marry without her wedding gown, from the bottom of the sea. The king sent the huntsman for it. He rode the horse to the sea, where the horse found a great crab (or lobster) and threatened to crush it. The crab asked the horse to spare it and summoned all the crabs to fetch the wedding gown.

Princess Vasilisa refused to marry without the king ordering the huntsman to bathe in boiling water. The huntsman went to his horse, who charmed his body. He bathed in the boiling water and became handsome. The king went to bathe in the same water, and died. The people took the huntsman as king instead, and he married the princess.</p>
        <p>In Slavic mythology and folklore, <code>the Firebird</code> is a magical and prophetic glowing or burning bird from a faraway land which is both a blessing and a harbinger of doom to its captor.</p>
